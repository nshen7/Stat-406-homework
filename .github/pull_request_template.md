# You are about to submit

Make sure of the following:


### Does your PR have the right files?

* You should see both the `.Rmd` **and** the knitted `.pdf` for ONLY the homework you are submitting.

:radioactive: Failure to include the PDF will result in -4/10.

### Make sure your PDF is legible

:crab: Code and text must not run off the edge of the paper. -2/10  
:nauseated_face: Don't print piles of Warnings/Messages into the pdf. Use `message=FALSE` and `warning=FALSE` in 
the `R` chunk to suppress these. -2/10  
:skull_and_crossbones: When asked for explanations or answers, these are not given as comments in `R` code. They 
must be text in the boxes. -2/10  


### If you consulted with anyone on the HW (other than the TAs)

:innocent: Write their names here.
